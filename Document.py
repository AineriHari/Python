1. Python is a fastest growing language in terms of
    a. number of developers who are using
    b. number of libraries
    c. number of companies who are using
    d. number of areas implemented
        i. Machine Learning
        ii. GUI
        iii. Software developement
        iv. Web Developement
        so it called as General purpose language.
        
2. It is a Interpreted, Object-Oriented and High-level language
    a. Interpreted: it reads the program from step by step later start to execute
    b. Supports Object-Oriented, Procedure and functional language.
    c. High-level: user can able to understand the language which is called as High-level language.
    
3. Python came into 1989 founded by Guido Van Rossum.
    He is big fan of British movie called "Moty Python Flying Circus". So he went that name Python.
    
4. Python 1.0 - January 1994
   Python 2.0 - October 2000
   Python 3.0 - December 2008
   
   Python 2.0 and Python 3.0 are both different types of versions. So no backword comfortability from Python 2.0 to Python 3.0
   
5. Python IDE (Integrated Developement Environment)
   IDE: >>> is a interactive shell
   REPL:
   R - Read
   E - Execute
   P - Print
   L - Loop
   
6. BODMAS Rule: Brackets((), {},[]), Orders(x**2, sprt(x)), Division, Multiple, Addition and Subtraction.
7. "\" it will skip the special meaning of the any valid sysmbols in Python.
8. variable: variable is a container which stores the data in it.
   How variables are assigned in Python?
        1. create a new object which is depending on the data type (int, str, float and bool).
        2. add the data to an object.
        3. assign the name which is user name to object.
9. variables are dynamic type which means we can change values.
    variables are immutables we can change data in same address.
    
10. data types:
    None, Numeric (int, float and bool), sequence (list, tuple, range, set, string) and mapping or dictionary
    
11. Operators:
    1. Arthimetic
    2. assigment
    3. relational or comaparision
    4. logical
    5. bitwise
    6. identity
    7. membership"""
